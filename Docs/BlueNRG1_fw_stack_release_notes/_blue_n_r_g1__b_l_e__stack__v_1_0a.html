Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack binary image files</h1>
<p>This section lists the BLE stack binary library files to be used for the BlueNRG-1 System On Chip configuration: <br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>BlueNRG-1 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Stack binary libraries <b>v1.0a</b>: <ul>
<li>
IAR, EWARM for ARM library: bluenrg1_stack_lib.a </li>
<li>
Keil, MDK-ARM library: bluenrg1_stack_lib_keil.lib </li>
<li>
Atollic, TrueStudio library: libbluenrg1_stack_lib_atollic.a </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>NOTES</b>: <ul>
<li>
BlueNRG-1 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack binary library files <b>v1.0a</b> are available on folder: <b>Library\Bluetooth_LE\library </b>. Each file must be linked to the built user application in order to get access to the BlueNRG-1 BLE stack features. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="S11"></a>
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) stack network coprocessor configuration</h1>
<ul>
<li>Two network coprocessor modes are supported: SPI and UART (mainly for RF evaluation purpose). </li>
<li>The network coprocessor over SPI specification aims at achieving the following targets: <ul>
<li>
Very similar to BlueNRG, BlueNRG-MS protocol </li>
<li>
Power efficient </li>
<li>
Code efficient </li>
<li>
Fast data transfer </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DTM project and related workspaces provides reference appplications for configuring the BlueNRG-1(STEVAL-IDB007V1) as a network coprocessor (refer to BlueNRG-1 DK Release notes documentation for more information).</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="S12"></a>
New Features</h1>
<p>This section lists the solved issues compared to BLE Stack v1.0 <br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>No new features have been added.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="S13"></a>
Solved Issues</h1>
<p>This section lists the solved issues compared to BLE Stack v1.0 <br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>ID 1404: Unwanted behavior on the stack timer APIs </li>
<li>ID 1454: If device not in advertising, the stack timer does not work </li>
<li>ID 1332: If uncorrect advertising intervals are given to ACI_GAP_SET_DISCOVERABLE and ACI_GAP_SET_LIMITED_DISCOVERABLE default advertising intervals are now used </li>
<li>ID 2025: Device doesn't go to sleep after long write procedure </li>
<li>ID 2181: Unexpected disconnection for Supervision Timeout after a connection update </li>
<li>ID 2182: TimeBase corruption in case of connection update (master slot) </li>
<li>ID 2297: The LinkLayer test TP_SEC_MAS_BV-14-C does not PASS </li>
<li>ID 2304: Uncorrect value returned for HCI_READ_LOCAL_SUPPORTED_COMMANDS </li>
<li>ID 2310: HCI_READ_LOCAL_VERSION_INFORMATION shall be updated for BTLE 4.2 Certification </li>
<li>ID 2314: Round robin algorithm issue when scanning while connected as a slave </li>
<li>ID 2315: Disconnection with "Instant passed" error when connected with 2 masters. </li>
<li>ID 2316: Timebase can be corrupted if a slot is allocated while a Create Connection is not yet finalized (Mode 4) </li>
<li>ID 2318: Resolvable address sent as identity address in pairing when privacy is enabled </li>
<li>ID 2320: Client characteristic configuration descriptor wrongly reset with multiple connections </li>
<li>ID 2321: GATT Timer started for write commands is not neeeded </li>
<li>ID 2322: Slave abruptly disconnects if any non-empty packet is received after an encryption failure </li>
<li>ID 2342: A wrong offset is used to evaluate if the current Random Address was Static or Private when distributing the address in the Identity Address Information packet. </li>
<li>ID 2356: No scan response sent if scanning was done and random address is used</li>
</ul>

Limitations/Bugs</h1>
<p>This section lists the issues known at firmware image release time. Issues found after this release are listed as solved or limitations on newer releases.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>ID 2353: When the slave latency is different from 0, BlueNRG-1 skips N connection intervals (where N is the slave latency) even if it has data to be sent to the master. </li>
<li>ID 2011: Missing HCI_DISCONNECTION_COMPLETE_EVENT event </li>
<li>ID 1688: BlueNRG does not stop advertising immediately, but only after next scheduled packet. </li>
<li>ID 1687: Scanning performed with a maximum duty cycle of 95% </li>
<li>ID 1679: Direct connection establishment procedure cannot be cancelled after a connection has been established as a slave </li>
<li>ID 1676: Privacy-enabled slave allowed to use non-resolvable private address in connectable mode, while it has to be forbidden </li>
<li>ID 1675: A privacy-enabled Central is allowed to use static and public addresses during some GAP procedures </li>
<li>ID 1673: It is not possible to use whitelist with ACI_GAP_START_OBSERVATION_PROC </li>
<li>ID 1663: No service changed indication sent if a reset occurs before disconnection </li>
<li>ID 1661: Device may hang for 32s if XO start-up time exceedes the IFR HS_STARTUP_TIME value </li>
<li>ID 1659: Not able to do fast advertise when all the connections have long connection intervals </li>
<li>ID 1685: Anchor Interval reduction enhancement is not enabled</li>
</ul>
